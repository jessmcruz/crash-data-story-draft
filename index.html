      <h1>Crashes at Major Hartford Intersections in 2018-2022</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead">The question we will be answering is “Which Hartford intersections have had the most crashes, by type, in recent years?” This question is important to the city of Hartford because according to McCoy & McCoy, a Connecticut Personal Injury Law firm, from 2020-2022, Hartford had the third highest crash rate in the state of Connecticut. This particularly is important because one may assume that Hartford has that crash rate due to the population, although this can be true, Hartford has the fourth highest population in Connecticut (Connecticut Demographics by Cubit, 2021). Therefore, there is a larger concern for prevention of crashes in Hartford because other cities, for example Stamford, experiences less crashes than Hartford despite having greater population sizes.</p>

          <p> class="lead">Additionally, intersections, in contrast to corridors, have traffic flow in multiple directions along with numerous intersection-specific traffic rules such as traffic lights and stop signs. This puts more variables in driving that may cause collisions. By researching the intersections with higher percentages of crashes and the types of crashes, city planners can identify areas of conflict and what type of interventions are needed. These interventions distinguish which street facilities, including speed limits, street lighting, speed bumps, sign placement, etc., need improvement and where, locationally, they must be improved. Furthermore, by breaking the crashes down by injuries, we can further pinpoint which intersections are causing the most serious levels of injuries to which city planners can focus and fund most changes in those areas.</p>

          <h2>Findings & Evidence</h2>
          <p>With this limited number of intersections, it is hard to determine what this data means for Hartford as a whole. However, we found that from <a href='https://datavizforall.org/hartford-crashes/'> the Hartford Crash (Heat) Map</a>, the ten major intersections that we selected based on indication of high density of crashes, make up slightly over 4% of crashes in Hartford (shown in the Table 1 below). Notably, Morgan St and Market St make up almost 1% of the total crashes in Hartford as a singular intersection. Although this is a small percentage, out of the many corridors and intersections in the city of Hartford, these numbers are significant.</p>
          <p>Based on our visualizations, we are unable to determine the causes of these crashes, as correlation cannot be equated with causation, and we do not have information on which intersections have stop lights, multi-lane roads converging, etc., but there is a high frequency of crashes at many Hartford intersections.<p>
          <p>--Add table code: Input table (table 1)--<p>
          <p>Furthermore, as seen in our interactive datawrapper visualization (screenshot shown below) we have found that these 10 intersections, while having high concentrations of crashes, had low numbers of fatal crashes. The chart shows the number of crashes at ten major intersections in Hartford, sorted by the most serious injury in each crash. It shows that there is no correlation between frequency of accidents and severity of accidents.<p>

          <p>Figure 1 <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/pIGkw/">interactive chart</a> as seen above, shows the number of crashes at ten major intersections in Hartford, sorted by the most serious injury in each crash. It shows that there is no correlation between frequency of accidents and severity of accidents.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>To find this data, we saved <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HI899d6iCizLMo9bB4Q9whmuD6UXmxZjBBhVhqAsIZE/edit?usp=sharing'>the list of Hartford crashes</a> (not including Interstate crashes) provided by Jack from the UConn Crash Repository. We uploaded this data into mapshaper in order to create a map of Hartford to be combined with our intersection data later on. Using the “console” tab, we typed “-points x=Longitude y=Latitude” and “-proj wgs84” to make the points take the shape of Hartford rather than a grid.</p>
          </p>We looked at <a href='https://datavizforall.org/hartford-crashes/'>the Hartford crash map</a> to determine intersections that have had high numbers of crashes since 2018. We then used placemark to create polygons in each of those intersections and named them according to their location as well as titled them as intersections. We exported this as a geojson file so that we will be able to add to it and eventually combine it with the mapshaper map.</p>
        </p>After that, we imported the placemark file into mapshaper and merged it with the existing map by typing “-join polygons10 fields=’intersection’” and then exported it as a geojson.</p>
        </p>The following images show the placemark map of intersections, the mapshaper map of crashes, and the combined mapshaper map.</p>
